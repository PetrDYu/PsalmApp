/**
 * Provides support to manage composable images. This class should be instantiated in a viewmodel that is
 * attached to the root composable instance of a screen. One of the key functions of ImageManager is to
 * cache and update the painter object for Image composables and provide either a newly constructed painter
 * when required or to reuse the cached painter such as when the user is exiting a screen (like hitting
 * the Back button). Reusing a cached painter is needed when an image is displayed on a screen that uses
 * animated visibility. Without restoring the cached painter prior to returning to the previous screen,
 * the image will flicker. This is due to an image being recomposed during the screen's animated exit and
 * the [rememberImagePainter] gets destroyed. Caching the state of a painter restores the state of an Image
 * without Compose having to recompose the image.
